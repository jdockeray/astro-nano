This blog will prefer to show code in markdown and GitHub gist. I will also use the online tool Carbon to create code images when showing output or emphasizing specific points. I want to be consistent in using Carbon, and this blog post will serve as a reference for the current settings and conventions in place.

## File types
Carbon is currently used for the following file types
- `sh_output`: Bash and shell output.

## File names
Prefix images created with Carbon with the word `carbon` and the type of language they support.
- ✅ `carbon_sh_output_1.png`
- ❌ `output_1.png`

## Config Settings
Find the various configs [here](https://gist.github.com/jdockeray/0bd7c134b0aa844deaa7c6a5a4f5f673).
